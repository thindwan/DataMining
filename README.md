# Link to the Dataset:

Due to bigger size of the dataset we are unable to upload dataset file. Thus, we have shared the link of the drive. 

# This Folder has 3 implementation files with name as below:
1) Data Preprocessing - Preprocessing of dataset to make analysis. Steps like data manipulation, data cleaning, data transformation are                           ,data imputation are involved.

2) Random Forest - To select best and important features out of list of feature from dataset we have applied Feature Importance technique                    using RandomForestRegressor. Obtained important features are utilized in the modeling.

3) Regression -  This file of code contains the modeling technique Linear Regression that we have applied to check correlation of                          extracted features by analysing performance metrics of the model.

# Order to follow to implement code:
Data Preprocessing -> Random Forest -> Regression

# GUI Implementation:
1) Use the file Grp5_GUI_Final
2) Ensure you have the supporting files located in this repository. These files include: (a) Airbnblogo.png (b)airbnb_price.csv (c) airbnb_features.csv (d) airbnb_cleaned.csv (e) Regression_features.csv
